# Database Migrations with **Alembic**

This folder contains every change we have ever made to the database schema.  
The tool that tracks and applies those changes is **[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/)**.

## 1  What Alembic Does

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Revision** | A new Python file describing the *next* change (add table, drop column, etc.) is created in `versions/`. |
| **Upgrade** | Alembic reads the pending revision files in order and executes the `upgrade()` function in each one against the database. |
| **Downgrade** | If you need to roll back, Alembic runs the `downgrade()` function in reverse order. |

Think of each file in **`versions/`** as a *git commit*, but for your database.

## 2  Creating a New Migration

We never call `alembic revision` directly.  
Instead, run the helper script from the **scripts** folder using command:

python scripts/alembic_create_migration_wrapper.py "short description of change"
